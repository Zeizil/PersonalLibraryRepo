## Description

This website displays an interactive catalog of books from a database of bestsellers that users can browse through and rate their preferences. Users can create an account and log in to generate a personalized list of books on which they can comment on and leave their ratings that new or returning users can then view.


## User Story

As an enthusiastic reader, I want to be able to browse through a catalog of bestsellers to view other usersâ€™ reviews and leave comments, so that I can make recommendations to others while also selecting my next read that caters to my preferences. 

## Usage

As it currently stands, going to the site will take you a a 'homepage' which will allow you to search (via Open Library API) for books. Upon rendering of the results, you may add the books of your choice to your personal inventory. For this part, you will need an account -- if you aren't logged in, you'll be redirected to do so, or create a new account. All of the books in your inventory can be accessed via the 'profile' button in the Nav. You can click on the title of any book to bring up a 'details' screen of that one book, where you can your own commetnary or a review of the book (this feature is currently WIP).
